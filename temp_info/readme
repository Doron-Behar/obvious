Temp Zone widget

This widget is a temperature monitor. It gets its information from acpi, to make it as 
usable as posible. 

To use it, include it into your rc.lua by inserting this line:
    require("obvious.temp_info")
into the top of your rc.lua. Then add the widget to your wibox. It's called
    obvious.temp_info()
